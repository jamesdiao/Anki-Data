### Background

Just as a quick intro: Anki is a flashcard app, much like Quizlet. You learn by testing yourself on flashcards; you can either make them yourself or download shared decks from online (see my post on [Anki for Medical School](http://jamesdiao.com/medical_school/anki) for more info). 

To better understand my own data and my workload for the next year (but also just for fun), I've developed a suite of tools for playing around with Anki's scheduling data, including: 

1. Card distributions
2. Learn/review history
3. Workload projection
4. Workload simulator
5. Report generation


### Improvement Areas

1. Loading feedback for report generation
2. Productivity over the day 
3. Setup Shiny Server
